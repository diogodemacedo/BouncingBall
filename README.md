This is a very basic matlab/octave script simulating the kinematics of a bouncing ball, in one dimension. One must first set the initial conditions, including the acceleration due to gravity, initial height of the ball, initial velocity, and associated coefficient of restitution. The output of the program are two plots describing the position and velocity of the ball as a function of time, until it stops.
