This is a very basic matlab/octave script simulating the kinematics of a bouncing ball, in one dimension. One must first set the simulation parameters, including the acceleration due to gravity, the initial height of the ball, its initial velocity, and lastly the coefficient of restitution. The output of the program are two plots describing the position and velocity of the ball as a function of time, until it stops.
